Django Better Migrations
========================

This project aims at providing improvements to Django's default migration system.
The default migration system is over-engineered, sometimes dangerous, and not
team work friendly.

TODO: document more the rationale and why not direct contributions to Django upstream.


Features
--------

- [ ] directly see generated SQL in migration files
- [ ] implement a set of rules to protect against dangerous actions in production
- [ ] support team-friendly migrations, with no dependencies management and unique names
